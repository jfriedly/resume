Why?
----

Started tracking this in git because I was having way to much trouble keeping track of the different versions of my resume.
Added the CV later when it was requested, but it's basically just an expanded version of the resume.

As an added bonus, creating a resume or CV tailored to a specific company is as simple as creating a branch off of master!


Compiling
---------

On Debian-based distributions, you'll need to install `texlive-latex-base`, `texlive-latex-recommended`, and `texlive-latex-extra`.

Then compile with `pdflatex resume.tex` and / or `pdflatex cv.tex`.


Credit

I used Theodore Pavlic's CV template.
