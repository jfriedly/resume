\documentclass[10pt]{article}

% The automated optical recognition software used to digitize resume
% information works best with fonts that do not have serifs. This

% least the second) to restore a Roman font (i.e., a font with serifs).
\usepackage{times}

% The OCR software also has a hard time with italics. These commands get
% rid of the two common ways to italicize text in LaTeX. Get rid of them
% to turn italics back on.

%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP

% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines

\section{\textbf{Abilities}}

\begin{loneinnerlist}
    \item Competent programmer in Java and Python, and some familiarity with C and C++.
    \item Responsible operator trusted to "figure out what's wrong and fix it" in production.
    % I used to have a note in here about understanding concepts of distributed consensus, cluster scheduling, data flow analysis, query optimization, and principles of API planning.  I think I'm so rusty on most of that stuff that it would do more harm than good on my resume.  New topics though...?
    \item Eager to learn:  personal projects include a three-month physics internship at \href{http://alpha.web.cern.ch/}{CERN} during a sabbatical, \href{https://github.com/jfriedly/k-and-r}{publishing} answers to the programming exercises in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language}{K \& R}, and writing an educational \href{https://github.com/jfriedly/my-lisp}{implementation of Lisp}.
    \item Can speak to customers, build rapport, and write user-facing documentation.
