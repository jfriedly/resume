Why?
----

Started tracking this in git because I was having way to much trouble keeping track of the different versions of my resume.

As an added bonus, creating a resume tailored to a specific company is as simple as creating a branch off of master!


Compiling
---------

On Debian-based distributions, you'll need to install `texlive-latex-base`, `texlive-latex-recommended`, and `texlive-latex-extra`.

Then compile with `pdflatex resume.tex`.

I used Theodore Pavlic's CV template.
